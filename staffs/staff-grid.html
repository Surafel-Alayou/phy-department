                <h5>Professor in Space Physics</h5>
                <p>As a space physicist, I am currently affiliated with Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia, where I have taken on various academic roles throughout my career. I've served as the department head of Physics at Bahir Dar University, and I am currently working as the vice dean for Postgraduate, Research, and Community Engagement at the university's College of Science. I am also connected with the Washera Geospace and Radar Science research center, which operates under the Department of Physics at Bahir Dar University. 
                  
                  With over 20 years of experience in teaching and research in the field of space physics, I have authored more than 25 peer-reviewed papers. My research primarily focuses on the impact of space weather on the upper atmosphere and the use of ionospheric tomography to characterize the ionosphere. In addition to my roles at Bahir Dar University, I also serve as an Adjunct Professor at the Institute of Geophysics, Space Science, and Astronomy (IGSA) at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. 
                  
                  I have contributed to the scientific community by participating in the peer review process for several prominent international journals, including Radio Science, Advances in Space Research, Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, and the Journal of Applied Physics. My extensive teaching and research experience, combined with my service to the scientific community, have established me as a respected and influential figure in the field of space physics, both within Ethiopia and the broader region.</p>

                                    In this research, we examine the long-term ionospheric response to solar conditions from 
                                    using GPS-TEC observations from 8 stations in East Africa at low/equatorial latitudes. To determine the effects of solar activity on ionospheric vertical-Total-Electron-Content (vTEC), solar proxies (EUV, F10.7, and SSN) were used. We have applied statistical analysis and used quadratic fits with solar indices to find the types of trends, forecast vTEC, and describe the daily, monthly, and seasonal variations of vTEC. We stated the fluctuations and dependency of GPS-vTEC on solar activity. From seasonal analysis, the greater values of GPS-vTEC were observed in the equinox’s season from 2009–2016, followed by the December and June solstices, respectively. The highest values of GPS-vTEC were recorded in the years 2014 (70 and 67 TECU), 2013 (57 and 65 TECU), 2012 (56 and 60 TECU) at the March and September equinoxes, and the 2015 March equinox (68 TECU), and the lowest value of GPS-vTEC was recorded (2–3 TECU) for all seasons from 03 to 07 EAT. The changes in vTEC have confirmed worthy agreement with the changes in solar parameters, and EUV flux has a stronger association with vTEC than the F10.7 and SSN by 2% and 7%, respectively. Daily and monthly variations of vTEC showed positive associations with the solar parameters (EUV, F10.7, and SSN) from 2009–2019. We got both linear and nonlinear trends; however, when we approximated 
                                    , and 
                                    coefficients, linear trends in vTEC were dominant. This analysis confirms that a quadratic polynomial can well capture the long-term solar activity dependency of vTEC in a statistical sense; based on the anticipated and observed vTEC values, the modeled outcome is suitable using EUV, F10.7, and SSN indices. But the modeled result is better using EUV and F10.7 than SSN in the region. In the predictions of vTEC, the maximum deviations and number of errors were observed during solar maxima years for EUV, F10.7, and SSN compared with the deviations and number of errors in solar minima years. Therefore, F10.7 is a better proxy of EUV flux in solar cycle 24 using monthly values, and the EUV flux is a better controller of GPS-vTEC changes compared to F10.7 and SSN, even if F10.7 is a proxy of EUV based on daily values.

                                    This paper focuses on the investigation of the long-term behavior of the equatorial ionosphere in Ethiopia. To explore the extended ionospheric variations, we analyze Total Electron Content (TEC) fluctuations in conjunction with solar activity indices, including F10.7 radio flux, EUV radiation, and Sunspot Number (SSN). The dataset used encompasses GPS-derived TEC records spanning 11 consecutive years from 2007 to 2017, corresponding to the period of solar cycle 24. Our analysis shows that the highest TEC levels generally occur during the post-noon hours, while the lowest values are observed around post-midnight or early morning. Notably, exceptions to this pattern are found in 2011 and 2013 when the highest TEC levels are observed during the December solstice. Otherwise, the seasonal TEC variation exhibits a semi-annual pattern, with peak TEC values occurring during the equinoxes and the lowest values during the solstices. Further examination demonstrates that in both solar activity phases, TEC magnitude is higher during the March Equinox compared to the September Equinox, and slightly higher during the December Solstice compared to the June Solstice. This reveals an asymmetry in the seasonal variations, encompassing the equinoxes, solstices, and the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle. Our study confirms that long-term fluctuations in ionospheric TEC closely correspond to variations in solar activity indices. Correlation analysis indicates a strong link between all solar activity indices and TEC. Notably, while a negative correlation is observed in 2007, the correlation in 2011 is remarkably stronger. Additionally, we find that the long-term TEC variation exhibits stronger correlations with EUV and F10.7 radio flux than with SSN, with correlation coefficients of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.78, respectively. Lastly, our study extends previous research by identifying the long-term trends of vertical TEC (vTEC) in relation to various driving factors such as F10.7, SSN, and EUV.

                                    This study examines the ionospheric response to the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) at latitudes near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) within the East African longitudinal sector. By analyzing data from ground-based magnetometers and GPS stations, the study explores how variations in the EEJ influence ionospheric parameters such as Total Electron Content (TEC) and ionospheric scintillations. The findings contribute to a better understanding of ionospheric processes in equatorial regions and their impact on satellite-based technologies.

                                    This paper investigates the medium-term response of the ionosphere to periodic changes in solar and geomagnetic activity over East Africa during 2015. Using data from GPS and magnetometer stations, the study assesses how periodic variations in solar flux and geomagnetic disturbances influence ionospheric parameters, including Total Electron Content (TEC) and ionospheric scintillations. The results provide insights into the ionospheric dynamics in the region, with implications for satellite-based communication and navigation systems that rely on stable ionospheric conditions.

                                          <p style="padding: 0; ">In this paper we studied the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities over Ethiopia as the consequence of the intense geomagnetic storm of March 2015 and June 2015. Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from six Ethiopian GPS reciever stations and those data were used to derive the ionospheric irregularities proxy indices, e.g.,rate of change of TEC (ROT) and ROT index (ROTI). These indices were used to characterize the intensity of the fluctuation of total electron content. ROTI was used as a criterion of ionospheric irregularities that took place during the storm. These indices were characterized along side with the disturbance storm time (Dst),the Interplanetary Electric Field (IEFy) and the SYM-H index (high resolution version of Dst) from ground-based magnetometers to see the effect of geomagnetic storm on horizontal component of geomagnetic field. Irregularities manifested in the form of fluctuations in TEC. Prompt penetration of electric field (PPEF) modulated the behaviour of irregularities during the initial and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storms. As a result,it was observed that the irregularities in the ionosphere of Ethiopia was in the range from weak to moderate. These irregularities generally occurred during the initial and recovery phases of the storm at all selected stations. The effect of electric field is found to depend on the local time at which the IMF Bz turned into southward. Therefore,east - west fluctuating Ey in March storm main phase is associated with suppression of irregularities in all stations and eastward Ey in the main phase of June 2015 is associated with small scale irregularity formation. The generation (inhibition) of irregularities is related to the effect of eastward (westward) storm time electric field disturbance dynamo electric fields and prompt penetration electric fields that created favourable (unfavourable) conditions for the generation of irregularities by uplifting (lowering) the F region.

                                          <p style="padding: 0; ">In this study, we used GPS-TEC measurements from six stations in East Africa located in low/equatorial latitudes to investigate medium-term ionospheric response to solar and geomagnetic circumstances during 2014–2016. Daily mean solar proxies (F10.7 and SSN) and geomagnetic activity indices (Kp and Dst) were used to determine solar and geomagnetic activity effects on ionospheric vertical Total-Electron-Content (vTEC). We have applied statistical analysis and quadratic fits with solar indices to find the type of trends, forecast vTEC, and describe the daily fluctuations of vTEC. Asab and Debark had the highest vTEC values among the six stations during the months of equinoxes in which they are located at 13.060 and 130 geographic latitudes, respectively. The highest vTEC values were 86, 80, and 75 TECU in March, October, and April 2014, respectively; 72 TECU in March and April 2015, and 70 TECU in February 2015. Within 24 hours, the magnitudes of vTEC were greater in February, March, and April 2014, 2015, and 2016 than in the remaining months. The changes in vTEC have demonstrated good agreement with the trend of solar parameters, and F10.7 has a stronger correlation with vTEC than SSN by 20%. The effects of solar activity on GPS-vTEC were positive, whereas the vTEC was disturbed during the storm’s main and recovery phases, which led to positive and negative ionospheric effects, respectively. We found both linear and non-linear trends. Nevertheless, when we approximated (F10.7)2 and (SSN) 2 coeffi- cients, linear trends in vTEC were dominant. The anticipated and observed vTEC measurements are in moderately good agreement.

Accurate estimated values of the atmospheric parameters are useful for weather forecasting and climate modeling and monitoring of climate change. Recently, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements have been applied for atmospheric sounding due to its robust data quality and wide horizontal and vertical coverage. The Global Positioning System (GPS) solutions that includes tropospheric parameters constitute a reliable set of data to be assimilated into climate models. The objective of this paper is, to estimate the neutral atmospheric parameters such as Wet Zenith Delay (WZD), Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) and Total Zenith Delay (TZD) using six selected GPS stations in the equatorial regions, more precisely the Ethiopian GPS stations from 2012 to 2015 observational data. Based on historic estimated GPS-derived values of PWV, we forecasted the PWV from 2015 to 2030. During data processing and analysis, we applied GAMIT-GLOBK software packages to estimate the atmospheric parameters. In the result, we found that the annual averaged minimum values of PWV are 9.72 mm for IISC and maximum 50.37 mm for BJCO stations. The annual averaged minimum values of WZD are 6 cm for IISC and maximum 31 cm for BDMT stations. In the long series of observations (from 2012 to 2015), we also found that there is a trend and cyclic patterns of WZD, PWV and TZD for all stations.

For developing countries, especially, for East Saharan African countries including Ethiopia, the backbone of the economy depends on agriculture and accurate weather information is demanding. Most of the weather information is obtained from traditional surface meteorology stations. The weather information obtained from this station is not accurate enough, had recording bias, and had lacked in a digital data center. The main objective of this research is to estimate and retrieve atmospheric parameters such as precipitable water vapour (PWV) using ground-based GPS and remote sensing techniques such as GPS Radio Occultation (RO) for accurate weather studies and forecasting. The specific objective of this work was to estimate the regional vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC) densities, using a linear combination of L1 and L2 carrier phase for higher-order time delays at different thin-shell layers of the ionosphere over GPS stations in Ethiopia. Besides this, we estimate the GPS zenith delays to characterize the error of the neutral troposphere. During this research, we collected raw observational datasets using ground-based GPS from 2012 to 2015 and applied formula and modeling methodology. We process GPS observed data through GPS Analysis (GAMIT/GLOBK) software. From GPS RO, we retrieved bending angle, refractivity, temperature, pressure, and humidity profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis and of the second generation National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrati

                                          <p style="padding: 0; ">This paper compares the occurrence of GPS Loss of Lock events from IGS network data to defined values of both the Amplitude scintillation index (S4) from a dedicated scintillation receiver of SCINDA network and the Amplitude scintillation proxy (S4-proxy) from IGS network data measurements in Bahir Dar. LOL may occur at any level of S4 due to other dominating factors; however, in our case studies, the threshold values of both S4 and S4-proxy are greater or equal to 0.7, which is responsible for the occurrence of LOL. Most of Loss-of-Lock events occurred when both S4 and S4-proxy were greater than or equal to 0.7, implying that LOL occurrence increases with the severity of scintillation and peaks for strong ionospheric scintillation, implying that low S4 and S4-proxy values were associated with infrequent Loss of Lock, whereas high values were usually associated with Loss-of-Lock. According to our findings, there were no Loss-of-Lock events in the absence of an intensive scintillation operation (S4 and S4-proxy ≥ 0.7). Ionospheric Scintillation never simultaneously occurred on all PRN signals to impact all satellites in the field of view of a receiver simultaneously, however only strong scintillation events S4 ≥ 0.7 and S4-proxy ≥ 0.7 values are causes of Loss-of-Lock. Loss-of-Lock events and higher S4 and S4-proxy values only occurred in the same region of the sky(North-West region) and during the same time, according to our observations. This implies that S4,S4-proxy and Loss-of-Lock are correlated in terms of temporal and azimuth distribution. The absence of geomagnetic storms on the days on which LOL were observed, rules out the likelihood that the occurrence of LOL at equatorial regions is linked to geomagnetic storms. As a result, we discovered that extreme ionospheric scintillation is a dominant cause of Loss-of-Lock events in the equatorial region, such as Bahir Dar. Finally, these findings suggest that ionospheric scintillation indices derived from IGS network data, such as S4-proxy values, are equally responsible for determining whether a Loss-of-Lock event is likely to occur and are appropriate for studying ionospheric scintillation in the regions where there are no dedicated scintillation receivers of the SCINDA network.

On average at the three stations,we confirmed that LOL events occurred within the hours of 19:00 LT-25:00 LT,while the maximum number of LOL events had been localized within the hours of 21:00 LT-23:00 LT. This implice that LOL events were more common during the post-sunset hours. On monthly basis, a maximum number of LOL events were observed in the months of April,and March, with a limited number of LOL events observed in the remaining months of the year at low latitudes,such as Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa stations. Seasonally, at the three stations and throughout 2015 studied maximum number of LOL occurrences were observed during equinoxes and substantially decreased during solstices. In particular, the months around the December solstice recorded the smallest number of LOL events for each station included here. We found that over the length of the 12 months of data included in this analysis, 551,782 and 160 LOL events had been observed in the Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa stations, respectively, inflicting extreme damage to GPS navigation. This implice that Debark station had the most LOL events, while Assosa station had the least number of LOL events, and Bahir Dar station had intermediate number of LOL events. We also found that the majority of LOL events in all stations took place when the elevation angle was low (between 30° and 40°),but Debark also has some LOL cases at higher elevations(greater than 50°) than other stations and Assosa had no LOL occurrences for higher elevations angle. Aside from that, LOL events show special azimuth distribution characteristics, with the discovered LOL events at the three stations concentrated in the northern areas of the sky between North-West and North-East [330°-360° ; 0°-30°]. Finally, it may also open up the opportunity of the usage of the quantity of LOL events as a proxy measure of ionospheric irregularity or ionospheric scintillation for low latitudes such as Ethiopia’s Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa.

                                                  <p style="padding: 0; ">In this paper we studied the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities over Ethiopia as the consequence of the intense geomagnetic storm of March 2015 and June 2015. Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from six Ethiopian GPS reciever stations and those data were used to derive the ionospheric irregularities proxy indices, e.g.,rate of change of TEC (ROT) and ROT index (ROTI). These indices were used to characterize the intensity of the fluctuation of total electron content. ROTI was used as a criterion of ionospheric irregularities that took place during the storm. These indices were characterized along side with the disturbance storm time (Dst),the Interplanetary Electric Field (IEFy) and the SYM-H index (high resolution version of Dst) from ground-based magnetometers to see the effect of geomagnetic storm on horizontal component of geomagnetic field. Irregularities manifested in the form of fluctuations in TEC. Prompt penetration of electric field (PPEF) modulated the behaviour of irregularities during the initial and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storms. As a result,it was observed that the irregularities in the ionosphere of Ethiopia was in the range from weak to moderate. These irregularities generally occurred during the initial and recovery phases of the storm at all selected stations. The effect of electric field is found to depend on the local time at which the IMF Bz turned into southward. Therefore,east - west fluctuating Ey in March storm main phase is associated with suppression of irregularities in all stations and eastward Ey in the main phase of June 2015 is associated with small scale irregularity formation. The generation (inhibition) of irregularities is related to the effect of eastward (westward) storm time electric field disturbance dynamo electric fields and prompt penetration electric fields that created favourable (unfavourable) conditions for the generation of irregularities by uplifting (lowering) the F region.

Daily mean solar proxies (F10.7 and SSN) and geomagnetic activity indices (Kp and Dst) were used to determine solar and geomagnetic activity effects on ionospheric vertical Total-Electron-Content (vTEC). We have applied statistical analysis and quadratic fits with solar indices to find the type of trends, forecast vTEC, and describe the daily fluctuations of vTEC. Asab and Debark had the highest vTEC values among the six stations during the months of equinoxes in which they are located at 13.060 and 130 geographic latitudes, respectively. The highest vTEC values were 86, 80, and 75 TECU in March, October, and April 2014, respectively; 72 TECU in March and April 2015, and 70 TECU in February 2015. Within 24 hours, the magnitudes of vTEC were greater in February, March, and April 2014, 2015, and 2016 than in the remaining months. The changes in vTEC have demonstrated good agreement with the trend of solar parameters, and F10.7 has a stronger correlation with vTEC than SSN by 20%. The effects of solar activity on GPS-vTEC were positive, whereas the vTEC was disturbed during the storm’s main and recovery phases, which led to positive and negative ionospheric effects, respectively. We found both linear and non-linear trends. Nevertheless, when we approximated (F10.7)2 and (SSN) 2 coeffi- cients, linear trends in vTEC were dominant. The anticipated and observed vTEC measurements are in moderately good agreement.

Accurate estimated values of the atmospheric parameters are useful for weather forecasting and climate modeling and monitoring of climate change. Recently, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements have been applied for atmospheric sounding due to its robust data quality and wide horizontal and vertical coverage. The Global Positioning System (GPS) solutions that includes tropospheric parameters constitute a reliable set of data to be assimilated into climate models. The objective of this paper is, to estimate the neutral atmospheric parameters such as Wet Zenith Delay (WZD), Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) and Total Zenith Delay (TZD) using six selected GPS stations in the equatorial regions, more precisely the Ethiopian GPS stations from 2012 to 2015 observational data. Based on historic estimated GPS-derived values of PWV, we forecasted the PWV from 2015 to 2030. During data processing and analysis, we applied GAMIT-GLOBK software packages to estimate the atmospheric parameters. In the result, we found that the annual averaged minimum values of PWV are 9.72 mm for IISC and maximum 50.37 mm for BJCO stations. The annual averaged minimum values of WZD are 6 cm for IISC and maximum 31 cm for BDMT stations. In the long series of observations (from 2012 to 2015), we also found that there is a trend and cyclic patterns of WZD, PWV and TZD for all stations.

For developing countries, especially, for East Saharan African countries including Ethiopia, the backbone of the economy depends on agriculture and accurate weather information is demanding. Most of the weather information is obtained from traditional surface meteorology stations. The weather information obtained from this station is not accurate enough, had recording bias, and had lacked in a digital data center. The main objective of this research is to estimate and retrieve atmospheric parameters such as precipitable water vapour (PWV) using ground-based GPS and remote sensing techniques such as GPS Radio Occultation (RO) for accurate weather studies and forecasting. The specific objective of this work was to estimate the regional vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC) densities, using a linear combination of L1 and L2 carrier phase for higher-order time delays at different thin-shell layers of the ionosphere over GPS stations in Ethiopia. Besides this, we estimate the GPS zenith delays to characterize the error of the neutral troposphere. During this research, we collected raw observational datasets using ground-based GPS from 2012 to 2015 and applied formula and modeling methodology. We process GPS observed data through GPS Analysis (GAMIT/GLOBK) software. From GPS RO, we retrieved bending angle, refractivity, temperature, pressure, and humidity profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis and of the second generation National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrati

LOL may occur at any level of S4 due to other dominating factors; however, in our case studies, the threshold values of both S4 and S4-proxy are greater or equal to 0.7, which is responsible for the occurrence of LOL. Most of Loss-of-Lock events occurred when both S4 and S4-proxy were greater than or equal to 0.7, implying that LOL occurrence increases with the severity of scintillation and peaks for strong ionospheric scintillation, implying that low S4 and S4-proxy values were associated with infrequent Loss of Lock, whereas high values were usually associated with Loss-of-Lock. According to our findings, there were no Loss-of-Lock events in the absence of an intensive scintillation operation (S4 and S4-proxy ≥ 0.7). Ionospheric Scintillation never simultaneously occurred on all PRN signals to impact all satellites in the field of view of a receiver simultaneously, however only strong scintillation events S4 ≥ 0.7 and S4-proxy ≥ 0.7 values are causes of Loss-of-Lock. Loss-of-Lock events and higher S4 and S4-proxy values only occurred in the same region of the sky(North-West region) and during the same time, according to our observations. This implies that S4,S4-proxy and Loss-of-Lock are correlated in terms of temporal and azimuth distribution. The absence of geomagnetic storms on the days on which LOL were observed, rules out the likelihood that the occurrence of LOL at equatorial regions is linked to geomagnetic storms. As a result, we discovered that extreme ionospheric scintillation is a dominant cause of Loss-of-Lock events in the equatorial region, such as Bahir Dar. Finally, these findings suggest that ionospheric scintillation indices derived from IGS network data, such as S4-proxy values, are equally responsible for determining whether a Loss-of-Lock event is likely to occur and are appropriate for studying ionospheric scintillation in the regions where there are no dedicated scintillation receivers of the SCINDA network.

                                                  <p style="padding: 0; ">In this paper, we investigated the occurrence of GPS Loss of Lock(LOL) events and its characteristics in Ethiopia using three dual-frequency geodetic GPS receivers in Bahir Dar (geographic 11.599°N,37.359°E), Debark (geographic 13.150°N, 37.893°E), and Assosa (geographic 10.051°N,34.553°E) during the period from January to December for the year 2015. On average at the three stations,we confirmed that LOL events occurred within the hours of 19:00 LT-25:00 LT,while the maximum number of LOL events had been localized within the hours of 21:00 LT-23:00 LT. This implice that LOL events were more common during the post-sunset hours. On monthly basis, a maximum number of LOL events were observed in the months of April,and March, with a limited number of LOL events observed in the remaining months of the year at low latitudes,such as Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa stations. Seasonally, at the three stations and throughout 2015 studied maximum number of LOL occurrences were observed during equinoxes and substantially decreased during solstices. In particular, the months around the December solstice recorded the smallest number of LOL events for each station included here. We found that over the length of the 12 months of data included in this analysis, 551,782 and 160 LOL events had been observed in the Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa stations, respectively, inflicting extreme damage to GPS navigation. This implice that Debark station had the most LOL events, while Assosa station had the least number of LOL events, and Bahir Dar station had intermediate number of LOL events. We also found that the majority of LOL events in all stations took place when the elevation angle was low (between 30° and 40°),but Debark also has some LOL cases at higher elevations(greater than 50°) than other stations and Assosa had no LOL occurrences for higher elevations angle. Aside from that, LOL events show special azimuth distribution characteristics, with the discovered LOL events at the three stations concentrated in the northern areas of the sky between North-West and North-East [330°-360° ; 0°-30°]. Finally, it may also open up the opportunity of the usage of the quantity of LOL events as a proxy measure of ionospheric irregularity or ionospheric scintillation for low latitudes such as Ethiopia’s Bahir Dar, Debark, and Assosa.
